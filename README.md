These are notes about navigation of this site and where is what.

The menu can be update in file "_data/navigation.yml"

The pages being pointed to by the navigation are located in 
the folder "pages" each one corresponds to a file with .md extension

At the moment I have chosen to use the layout "page"
but there are several other layouts that in the folder "_layout"
that can be explored

In file "config.yml" you can see that posts form the feed.
I have not yet experimented with it. This is also the file where logos
are inserted. And the social media hooks etc. They are near the top of
the file. You can also see that the cover image is defined in line 
cover_image: "/assets/img/bg/page-title.jpg" 
I have just inserted an image of sunset in there as place holder, one
can either put in another image with the same path and filename, or
change the line in config.yml and use some other filename.

In general images are movies live in assets folder.

Slider images that show up on homepage and landing page are located in 
"assets/img/slider", and file where name of the files in that folder
appear is "_includes/slider.html"
