    Accessing the hidden universe of quarks and gluons is a challenge requiring
    expertise across multiple disciplines. Theorists provide rigorous
    mathematical expressions that connect the footprints of this hidden universe
    to observational data. Experimentalists enable realistic simulations of
    complex particle reactions at world-class facilities such as Jefferson Lab
    and the future Electron-Ion Collider. To reconstruct the details of this
    hidden universe, data scientists orchestrate end-to-end, simulation-based
    inference. Processing the full simulation pipeline and the large-scale data
    from these experiments demands high-performance computing expertise.
    Finally, data-visualization specialists render the reconstructed information
    as tomographic images of the sub-femtometer-scale world.

    Our theory team, consisting of researchers from Jefferson Lab and
    Argonne National Laboratory, is pushing forward the frontiers of
    quantum chromodynamics by developing and extending factorization frameworks.
    These allow quantum correlation functions to be measured in an increasingly
    large variety of experimental processes at Jefferson Lab and the future
    Electron Ion Collider, and also allow radiative effects from electromagnetic
    interactions to be incorporated into theoretical models.
    Moreover, we are developing and deploying numerical implementations of
    these frameworks using modern finite element methods,
    allowing the frameworks to be employed in an auto-differentiable,
    machine learning-friendly pipeline.

    Our experimental working group, including researchers from Jefferson Lab,
    is developing a novel, simulation-based inference method in a conceptual
    Bayesian framework designed for Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
    We develop new techniques to solve ill-posed inverse problems powered by
    advanced scientific computing and machine learning methods.
    The conceptual Bayesian GAN framework allows for accessible quantification
    of statistical uncertainties.
    The accurate estimation of statistical uncertainties is necessary
    to reveal systematic effects and bias.
    These methods provide high-fidelity and expressive extraction of
    Quantum Correlation Functions that can be seamlessly incorporated into
    our event-level framework for effective representation of physics experiments.

    Our applied mathematics team is developing a next-generation, simulation-based 
    inference methodology that allows accurate event-level data analysis. We develop 
    scalable inverse-problem solvers powered by advanced scientific machine learning coupled 
    with rigorous statistical methodology, advanced sampling, and fast surrogate models 
    that accelerate inference by orders of magnitude. Together, these advances enable the 
    rapid and high-fidelity extraction of QCFs, providing theory with sharper constraints 
    and experiment and detector models with more realistic representations.

    Our supercomputing and visualization team is developing a scalable
    distributed learning framework, along with associated libraries and tools,
    to overcome the computational challenges of performing quark-gluon
    correlation function (QCF) inference, which, in turn, enables the femtoscale
    imaging of nuclei on exascale systems. As such, the team interfaces with
    applied mathematicians and AI researchers to map, optimize, or refactor the
    algorithms within the aforementioned framework, libraries, and tools for high
    performance on exascale systems, including a comprehensive visualization
    framework or library to support real-time, human-in-the-loop decision-making
    in machine-learning workflows, focusing on QCFs and their uncertainties.
