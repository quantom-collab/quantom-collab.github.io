title: Stress in quantum systems
layout: highlight
author: Adam Freese
summary: >-
  This work studies how stresses and momentum flow operate in bound
  quantum systems, with special attention paid to how stresses induced
  by the wave function guide particle motion.
  This study additionally shows how
  mechanical form factors—which are extracted from the quantum correlation
  functions measured at JLab and the EIC—can be used to image forces
  in bound quantum systems.
  The hydrogen atom is used as a case study, and it is shown that the mechanical
  form factors allow the Coulomb force law to be mapped out.

### Background

Mechanical form factors—which are extracted from high-energy particle collisions
at Jefferson Lab and the future Electron Ion Collider—are
commonly believed to encode stresses in hadrons.
A variety of high-profile publications from Jefferson Lab have
claimed to measure pressure in the proton,
including individual contributions
[from quarks](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0060-z)
and
[from gluons](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05730-4).
On the other hand, some researchers have
[questioned](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.106.034028)
whether these form factors really encode pressure and stresses.
This study investigates whether the mechanical form factors really encode stresses,
and ultimately validates the pressure interpretation
that is widely believed by researchers in the field.

### The Science

[This study](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.111.034047)
begins by evaluating the average momentum flux density—that is,
the average rate at which momentum is flowing,
as a function of space and time—for bound quantum systems prepared in an
arbitrary wave packet.
This density can be directly related to the mechanical form factors
measured in particle collision experiments through a Fourier transform.
The average momentum flow contains a mixture of contributions:
from the movement of the system as a whole,
from dispersion of the wave packet it is prepared in,
from movement of constituents inside the system,
and from forces acting on constituents.

Next, the study uses guidance from the
[pilot wave interpretation](https://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.85.166)
of quantum mechanics
to help separate all the contributions to the momentum flux density.
Contributions from the overall motion of the system
and from dispersion by the wave packet can be isolated and removed,
since they have nothing to do with the *internal* structure of the system.
What remains is a mixture of internal motion and internal forces.
The pilot wave interpretation allows a clean and exact separation between these.

The ground state of the hydrogen atom is studied as a paradigmatic example
of a quantum bound state.
For this state specifically, it is found that the internal momentum flux density
is due entirely to internal stresses—specifically,
pressure and tension in the static electric field,
and compressive pressure exerted by the bound state wave function
on the electron and proton.

An additional finding is that one of the mechanical form factors,
commonly called "cbar",
contains information about the net force acting on subsystems;
in the hydrogen atom, these subsystems are the electron, proton and electric field.
By measuring cbar, it is possible to recover the Coulomb force law—even if we did not
know it already.
This has promising implications for our ability to map the force law
in quantum chromodynamics from future empirical extractions of the cbar form factor.

### Impacts

The biggest impact of this study is that it validates the pressure interpretation
commonly attached to mechanical form factors.
Although the hydrogen atom is a much simpler system than the proton—the latter being
made of innumerably many quarks and gluons—such complications make the concept of
pressure *more* applicable rather than less.
What this study shows is that even a system consisting of merely two particles
already has continuum-like behavior,
because the wave function acts similarly to a continuous medium.

This study also shows that there is fertile ground in interdisciplinary research
applying insights from foundations of quantum mechanics to open questions in hadron physics.
