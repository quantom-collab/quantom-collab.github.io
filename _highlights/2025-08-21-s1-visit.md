### S1 Visit

On August 21, 2025, the United States Secretary of Energy,
Chris Wright, visited Jefferson Lab.
Secretary Wright was given presentations on the cutting-edge
science done at Jefferson Lab, including the use of artificial intelligence
to improve innovation and scientific operations.

Among those who presented to Secretary Wright was postdoctoral fellow
and QuantOm Collaboration member Adam Freese (pictured).
Adam spoke about Jefferson Lab's and QuantOm's efforts to extract distributions
of quarks and gluons using an AI/ML-based event-level inference framework.
Adam focused on the distribution of stresses felt by the quarks and gluons,
comparing and contrasting the proton to a drop of water.
Like a water droplet, the proton has compressive pressure at its core
and surface tension in its periphery;
but unlike a water droplet, which has only a very thin layer of surface tension,
the surface tension in a proton is diffuse&mdash;suggesting a fuzzy and extended boundary.

Additionally, Adam explained a finding of
[recent QuantOm-funded research]({{ site.url }}/highlights/2025-02-27-hydrogen-stresses.html)&mdash;which
was
[highlighted on Jefferson Lab's website](https://www.jlab.org/news/stories/sharper-image-subatomic-stress)&mdash;that
mapping these stress distributions will allow us to determine
the average force felt by quarks in a proton&mdash;a key step in empirically
determining the QCD equivalent of the Coulomb force law.
