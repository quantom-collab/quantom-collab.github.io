      <b>QuantOm's mission</b> is to develop the next-generation QCD analysis
      framework to reconstruct hadronic structure from event-level experimental
      data.
      We integrate state-of-the-art theoretical frameworks based on QCD
      factorization theorems, sophisticated experimental simulations, and a
      scalable computational architecture that leverages AI/ML techniques.
